### TIME TRACKING 

This project shows several cards with the daily, weekly, and monthly activity of users. In order to build this project I used HTML, CSS and JS as well.

My challege was to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the original design as possible.

If you are maybe interested in build it, you can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
